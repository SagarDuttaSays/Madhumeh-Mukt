Madhumeh Mukt is designed to provide individuals with an accurate prediction of their likelihood of developing diabetes in the future. Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide, and early detection and management can make a significant difference in the course of the disease. 

Therefore, there is a need for a reliable and accurate diabetes prediction model that can help individuals assess their risk of developing diabetes. This model is based on a sophisticated algorithm that takes into account several risk factors that are known to contribute to the development of diabetes. These risk factors include age, weight, family history of diabetes, physical activity, diet, and other health conditions such as hypertension.


Design and Development

The Madhumeh Mukt website was designed and developed with a user-friendly interface to provide a smooth user experience. The frontend of the website was developed using EJS and CSS3. The backend of the website was developed using NodeJS, ExpressJS, and Mongoose. MongoDB was used as the database for the website.

The diabetes prediction model was written in Python and was running separately on Flask. The model was trained using a large dataset of diabetes patients and used several risk factors that are known to contribute to the development of diabetes, including age, weight, family history of diabetes, physical activity, and diet. The model was fine-tuned to ensure accuracy and relevance.

To connect the website to the ML model, a RESTAPI was used. The RESTAPI allowed the website to communicate with the ML model, providing input to the model and receiving output from the model. The RESTAPI also allowed for the separation of concerns, ensuring that the ML model could be updated and maintained independently of the website.

Implementation

Frontend:

The frontend of the website was developed using EJS (Embedded JavaScript) and CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets). EJS was used to dynamically render HTML pages, which allowed us to reuse code and create a more efficient website. CSS3 was used to style the website, providing a visually appealing user interface.

Backend:

The backend of the website was developed using NodeJS, ExpressJS, and Mongoose. NodeJS is a popular server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allowed us to develop fast and scalable applications. ExpressJS is a lightweight framework that allowed us to create web applications easily. Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library that provided a straightforward way to work with MongoDB databases.

Database:

The database used for the website was MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. MongoDB is a document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like documents, making it easier to work with complex data structures. We used Mongoose to connect to the MongoDB database, define the data schema, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Machine Learning Model:

The diabetes prediction model was developed in Python and was running separately on Flask, a popular Python web framework. Flask provided a simple and flexible way to build web applications, making it an ideal choice for deploying machine learning models. We used RESTAPI to connect the Flask server to the Madhumeh Mukt website. The RESTAPI provided a standard way to communicate between the frontend and backend of the website.

Conclusion

The Madhumeh Mukt website is a reliable and accurate diabetes prediction model that can help individuals assess their risk of developing diabetes. The website's frontend uses EJS and CSS3, the backend uses NodeJS, ExpressJS, and Mongoose, and the database used is MongoDB. The ML model is written in Python and is running separately on Flask, and the website is connected to the ML model using RESTAPI. The website provides several features, including a diabetes prediction tool and valuable resources for individuals at risk of developing diabetes.

We understand that diabetes is a serious and complex condition, and our website is designed to help individuals make informed decisions about their health. Our model is based on the latest research and is constantly updated to ensure accuracy and relevance. Whether you are at risk for diabetes or simply looking to improve your overall health, we invite you to explore our website and learn more about our diabetes prediction model.
